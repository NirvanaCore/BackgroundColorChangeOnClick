## Background Color Change
-- initial white background color changes to different random color after clicking button.
i experimented with array and random method. like if you want particular color it can be seen by fetching from given array or if you want random  color then it can be either HEX color or RGB color code. I have done coding for all three, RGB is working other two are just commented out.
